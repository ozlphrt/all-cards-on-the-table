# Question Writing Guide — Making Cards More Fluid & Impactful

## Core Principles

### 1. **Immediate Clarity**
- Questions should be understood in one read
- Remove unnecessary words
- Start with the core concept

**Before:** "What is a small childhood memory that still makes you smile when you think about it?"  
**After:** "What childhood memory still makes you smile?"

### 2. **Natural Flow**
- Use conversational language
- Avoid formal constructions ("What is...", "Which of...")
- Make it feel like a friend asking

**Before:** "What is the earliest moment in your life that you remember clearly?"  
**After:** "What's your earliest clear memory?"

### 3. **Immediate "Wow" Factor**
- Create an instant emotional or intellectual hook
- Make people pause and think immediately
- Use surprising angles or unexpected framing

**Before:** "What is something you miss about the person you used to be?"  
**After:** "What did you lose when you grew up?"

### 4. **Concrete Over Abstract**
- Specific beats vague
- Use sensory details when possible
- Ground questions in real experiences

**Before:** "What is a simple pleasure you've loved for as long as you can remember?"  
**After:** "What's the smallest thing that's always made you happy?"

## Writing Patterns That Work

### Pattern 1: Direct Question
- Start with "What" or "When" or "Who"
- Keep it under 12 words
- One clear idea

**Examples:**
- "What moment changed how you see yourself?"
- "When did you first feel truly independent?"
- "Who showed you a different way to be?"

### Pattern 2: Contrast/Comparison
- Creates immediate thought
- Highlights change or difference

**Examples:**
- "What did you believe at 15 that you don't now?"
- "What's easier to remember than to forget?"
- "What's harder to say than to feel?"

### Pattern 3: Time-Based Reflection
- Uses temporal framing
- Creates perspective shift

**Examples:**
- "What would surprise your 10-year-old self about you now?"
- "What's something you've been avoiding for years?"
- "What did you learn the hard way?"

### Pattern 4: Identity/Transformation
- Questions about becoming
- Self-discovery focus

**Examples:**
- "What part of yourself took longest to accept?"
- "When did you realize you'd become someone new?"
- "What do you know about yourself that others don't?"

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Too wordy:** "What is something that you have experienced in your life that has had a significant impact on the way you view the world?"  
✅ **Better:** "What experience changed how you see the world?"

❌ **Too abstract:** "What is the nature of your relationship with vulnerability?"  
✅ **Better:** "When do you feel most vulnerable?"

❌ **Too formal:** "Which of the following childhood experiences has had the most profound effect on your adult personality?"  
✅ **Better:** "What from your childhood still shapes you?"

❌ **Multiple ideas:** "What is a decision you made that seemed small at the time but fundamentally changed the course of your life, and what did you do about it?"  
✅ **Better:** "What small decision changed everything?"

## Intensity-Specific Guidelines

### Candle 1 (Warm, Safe)
- Use gentle framing
- Focus on positive memories
- Make it feel safe to answer

**Good:** "What's a moment you'd want to relive?"  
**Avoid:** "What's your biggest regret?"

### Candle 2 (Personal)
- Everyday but meaningful
- Self-reflection without judgment
- Personal quirks and preferences

**Good:** "When do you feel most like yourself?"  
**Avoid:** "What's wrong with you?"

### Candle 3 (Emotional)
- Deeper feelings
- Values and patterns
- Relationship to self/others

**Good:** "What emotion do you struggle to name?"  
**Avoid:** "Why are you so emotional?"

### Candle 4 (Deep Vulnerability)
- Wounds and fears
- Mistakes and growth
- Heavier experiences

**Good:** "What truth about yourself took longest to accept?"  
**Avoid:** "What's your biggest failure?"

### Candle 5 (Shadows)
- Rarely shared truths
- Inner conflicts
- Unspoken stories

**Good:** "What have you never said out loud?"  
**Avoid:** "What's your darkest secret?"

## Revision Checklist

Before finalizing a question, ask:

2. ✅ Does it make you pause and think immediately?
3. ✅ Is it under 15 words? (12 is ideal)
4. ✅ Does it feel conversational, not formal?
5. ✅ Does it have an emotional or intellectual hook?
6. ✅ Is it specific enough to spark a real memory/thought?
7. ✅ Does it match the intensity level?
8. ✅ Would you want to answer this yourself?

## Examples: Before & After

**After:** "What truth about yourself are you avoiding?"

## The "Stanley Tucci" Test
